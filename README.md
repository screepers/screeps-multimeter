# screeps-multimeter
Multimeter is a hackable console for the game [Screeps](https://screeps.com/). It lets you access your Screeps console without loading up the full website (and as a result lets you play Screeps for much longer on a single battery charge), and is hackable with plugins.

Features:
- Terminal (command line) program, no browser or GUI required.
- Send console commands from the program.
- Rich console output formatting.
- Add plugins to get new functionality.

## Installation

```
npm install -g screeps-multimeter
multimeter
```

## Configuration

Multimeter now uses the [screeps unified credentials file](https://github.com/screepers/screepers-standards/blob/master/SS3-Unified_Credentials_File.md), as used by [screeps-api](https://github.com/screepers/node-screeps-api).

Example `.screeps.yaml` config file:

```
servers:
  main:
    host: screeps.com
    secure: true
    token: '00000000-0a0a-0a00-000a-a0000a0000a0'
  ptr:
    host: screeps.com
    secure: true
    path: '/ptr'
    token: '00000000-0a0a-0a00-000a-a0000a0000a0'
  season:
    host: screeps.com
    secure: true
    path: '/season'
    token: '00000000-0a0a-0a00-000a-a0000a0000a0'
  private:
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 21025
    secure: false
    username: bob
    password: password123
configs:
  multimeter:
    plugins: []
    aliases: {}
    logFilename: 'multimeter.log'
```

### Connecting to the official server

You will need to create a [Screeps API token](http://docs.screeps.com/auth-tokens.html) and update the config as appropriate.

### Connecting to a private server

To enable access to your own private server you will need to set up [screepsmod-auth](https://github.com/ScreepsMods/screepsmod-auth) and create a password. The username may be your username or email address, depending on the mod settings.

## Usage

The main interface has a command line on the bottom. Type `/help` to see a list of the available commands. Type `/quit` or `/q` to exit the program.

## Colors and Formatting

Console coloring and formatting is made possible by [blessed's tags](https://github.com/chjj/blessed#content--tags). Some of the tags you can use are:

- `{color-fg}` - Change the foreground color.
- `{color-bg}` - Change the background color.
- `{bold}, {underline}, {blink}, {inverse}, {invisible}` - Apply the character style.
- `{/style}` - Stop using the given style, e.g. `{/bold}`.
- `{/}` - Reset to normal characters.
- `{|}` - Align the rest of the line to the right.

Colors can be specified as a name, e.g. red, blue, yellow, cyan (see [colorNames from blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed/blob/eab243fc7ad27f1d2932db6134f7382825ee3488/lib/colors.js#L312) for a complete list), or as a hex code, e.g. `#ffff00`.

## Plugins

To add additional plugins, add them to a `plugins` array in your config file:

```
configs:
  multimeter:
    plugins: ["./plugins/myCustomPlugin"]
```

Multimeter ships with the following plugins enabled by default:

### Plugin: Alias

The alias plugin can be used to easily store and access commonly used console commands. Create a new alias by using `/alias NAME COMMAND`. Now, `/NAME` will automatically expand to `COMMAND`. For example, this alias will let you list all damaged creeps by typing `/damagedCreeps`:

```
/alias damagedCreeps _.filter(Game.creeps, (c) => c.hits < c.hitsMax)
/damagedCreeps
```

Aliases can also take parameters. There will be available in variables like `$1`, `$2`, etc. The entire passed string is available as `$args`. For example:

```
/alias hitsLeft "Creep " + $1 + " has " + Game.creeps[$1].hits + " hits left"
/hitsLeft Ryan
```

### Plugin: Watch

The watch plugin will log an expression to your console on every tick. To install it, copy [watch-client.js](lib/watch-client.js) to your script and add some code to your `loop` function:

```
var watcher = require('watch-client');
exports.loop = function() {
  // Rest of your code...

  watcher();
};
```

There are two ways to watch expressions. You can log it to the console normally by using `/watch console EXPR`. You can also log to a status bar at the bottom of the screen using `/watch status EXPR`. For example, `/watch status _.keys(Game.creeps).length` will keep a count of the number of live creeps at the bottom of the terminal.

The watch plugin will be automatically enabled for all shards with assigned CPU > 0.

### Plugin: HTML

The HTML plugin allows you to style the log output using the 'style' attribute of HTML tags. It converts the values for the style attributes to the relevant blessed tags. It should work with any html tags, though has only been tested with `<div>`, `<span>`, and `<a>`.

It currently supports: `color`, `background`, `bold`, and `underline`:

- Text color: `style="color: #00FFFF;` or `style="color: blue;"`
- Background: `style="background: #FFFF00;"` or `style="background: green;"`
- Bold: `style="font-weight: bold;"`
- Underline: `style="text-decoration: underline;"`

```
<span style="color: green;">Hello, World!</span>
```

Multiple styles may be included in a single tag:

```
<span style="color: #FF0000; background: blue; font-weight: bold;">Red-on-blue bolded text</span>
```

Tags may be nested:

```
<span style="color: #FF0000;">This is red <span style="color: #00FF00;">This is green </span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">This is bold red</span></span>

//The same string, with newlines for visual clarity
<span style="color: #FF0000;">
    This is red
    <span style="color: #00FF00;">This is green </span>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is red and underlined</span>
</span>
```

### Plugin: Logging

The logging plugin allows you to log screeps output and error output to a file. To enable logging, add logging to your config file:

```
configs:
  multimeter:
    logFilename: "multimeter.log"
```

To log errors to a separate file, add this to your multimeter config as well:

```
configs:
  multimeter:
    errorLogFilename: "screepsErrors.log"
```

## Contributing

If you have feedback, bugs, or feature requests for multimeter, don't hesitate to look through [the issues](https://github.com/CGamesPlay/screeps-multimeter/issues) and add your thoughts. Please search to see if someone else has already filed a related issue before you submit a new one.

Multimeter is built for hacking! The easiest way to add a feature to multimeter is to make a new plugin for it. If you need to change something and it can't be done with a plugin, you can fork multimeter and submit a pull request. Ideally, you can add the necessary hooks so that other plugins can take advantage of them.

Note that multimeter uses lodash 4, whereas screeps still uses lodash 3.
